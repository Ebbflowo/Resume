# Resume
The following code is a completed project from my AP Computer Science Course regarding 2D arrays.
This was created in IntelliJ IDEA

(If you want to play, please download Main.java, Room.java, and Board.java)

It is a 5 by 5 index long 2D array game inspired by my Dungeons & Dragons Campagin I am running.

The goal of a game is to catch a thief you cannot see. You and the thief take turns moving. The thief has it's own "AI" that moves according to the player. Every turn, you can do the following:
1. Move (move in any direction)
2. Cast Spell (cast two spells out of three possible choices -> fireball: lights up and blasts tiles in a specific row or column, spike growth: cast spiked traps along a given row or column, thunderwave: shocks the tiles in a 3 by 3 radius around the player).
3. Listen (hear and know the direction of the thief - eg. west, east)
4. Place Trap (place a trap on a tile. If the thief steps on it, he is caught)

After a certain amount of turns, you either win or lose!

If you would like to see an example of how the game works, you can see it here: https://www.loom.com/share/7fa3228c4d474f25b56f3d1be847697b
